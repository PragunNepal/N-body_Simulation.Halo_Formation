# N-body Simulation & Halo Formation
1. Open the Python Notebook File
2. Make the necessary changes - file path, your animation name, among others
3. The simulation is ready to run

The simulation is of 500 frames of redshift value for 32^3 particles coupled with the halo clusters formed by the n-body particles. The python notebook consists of 2 codes, one with and one without the axes. This simulation basically compares the n-body simulation and the halo formation simulation.
Since the original code was run on Jupyter Notebook, I recommend to use the same. The rendering time depends from ~10 minutes to ~25 minutes.
